## Working with a team or with contractors?
## Did you know the Unity Asset Store license requires each indavidual to have there own licenses?
This is a limitation imposed by Unity so not something we can help you with directly, if your working in a team you are intended to have each user license all assets indavidually with rare exception.
Heathen however does provide an alternative way of licensing its assets via the GitHub Sponsor program.

====================
PLEASE NOTE
====================

If you have issues where in Steam attempts to launch your game (or Spacewar) when you start simulating in Unity the most likely cause of this issue is that you do not have steam_appid.txt located in the root of your project.
steam_appid.txt is a simple text file that should be located in the root of your project (beside not in the Asset folder) it should contain only your app ID.

An example of a valid steam_appid.txt follows, only the content between the dashed lines should be used e.g. only the number 480 should be in the file.
               
               Start File
-----------------------------------------------
480
-----------------------------------------------
               End File
