# Xscape Legacy
The main repository for the Xscape Legacy game.

# Details
This Github contains the framework of Xscape Legacy's repository, however the majority of development is done within Unity. Github can only hold repos of up to 100mb, therefore all content and assets used within game development are held within Unity. Once reviewed and finalised within Unity, edits can be pushed to the Github repository. We can also provide access to Unity's version control in order to follow development progress.
Some example scenes and assets can be found within the 'Assets' folder. However grant funding would allow the development of a large amount of custom models and assets to be used.
Core framework for development settings can be found in 'ProjectSettings'
